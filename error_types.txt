3 Error Types
1) Logic Error
- This does not give an error message
- Your code that you wrote, is not running as you expected, but the program isnt breaking
2) Syntax Error
- VS Code will give you the error underline before running it
- Much easier to spot (the most common error, ironically)
3) Runtime Error
- Similar to a logic error, in that doesn't give you an underline
- The program will still run, until it gets to this point in the logic, then program breaks
