IF-ELSE
    used to check if something is true
TRY-CATCH
    to handle an error in a way that makes sense to your program
WHILE LOOP
    to do some code so long as a condition is true
FOR LOOP
    to do something a set number of times, or do something for each item in a sequence
    DOESNT MATTER IF SOMETHING IS TRUE OR FALSE
    Tells python "Do something this many times" or "do something for each item in this variable"
CLASSES
    a blueprint for an object, you're telling python "I have a bunch of things that need these characteristics"
    You want something to use the same 3 variables, but you don't want to have to type out those three variables everytime
    Instead of;
        name1 = "nick"
        name2 = "brad"
        nicks_age = 30
        brads_age = 50
        print("Hi my name is " + name1 + ". I am " + nicks_age)
        print("Hi my name is " + name2 + ". I am " + brads_age)
    You do this
        person = Person("nick", 30)
        person2 = Person("brad", 50)
        person.print_info()
        person2.print_info()
